Game stuff

Vague plan of action:
    1. Choose a starter pet (with different stats)
    2. Create a leveling system
    3. Create mini games to raise stats
    4. Create some sort of fighting ring
    5. Create some sort of racing

Long term:
    Multiple pets?
    Evolutions?
    Breeding?
    Another "main event"


--------------------------------------------------------------


Choose a starter pet:
    different starting stats
    stat gain per level?
        -randomized?

Training
    mini-games
    careful with timing-based things, it can be shitty if they're laggy

Goals
    Arena for fighting
    Some sort of racing?
        Multiple kinds of racing?
            chao style from sonic, different stats make different racing
    No/limited control during these, the goal is to use training to beat them

Multiple pets?

Evolutions?

Breeding?
